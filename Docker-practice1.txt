repeat

4) watch the video and perform the lab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR_uLlxlKwE&t=309s

ANSWER:
docker run -it --name bindmount1 -v "$(pwd)"/darren:/app ubuntu /bin/bash
ls
cd app
ls
touch file1
ls (file1 is present)
exit
ls ('darren' directory is present)
cd darren 
ls (file1 is present)

inside the 'daren' directory:
docker run -it --name volnew -v darren1:/app1 ubuntu /bin/bash
ls (app1 directory present)
cd app1
ls
touch file1
ls (file1 present)
exit
docker volume inspect darren1
this is the output:
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2022-10-06T07:33:51Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/darren1/_data",
        "Name": "darren1",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]

copy: /var/lib/docker/volumes/darren1/_data

cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/darren1/_data
ls (file1 is present)

Main difference between bindmount and docker volume:

Docker is created within the docker itself, inside this folder there is a directory called volumes, and inside here the shared volume is created

Bindmount is created within the host itself.


5) Perform this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2ZiT47tsm4  (not the part of devops...just to make you understand the importance of apache server and its use)

ANSWER:
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
which httpd
cd /var/www/html

****WHEN INSIDE THE HTML FOLDER, YOU NEED TO RUN: sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html !!! This gives permission to upload the zip file.
unzip website.zip
service httpd status
service httpd start
Once httpd is running, you can now copy the public ip of your instance, paste in the browser, and the website should be working.

6) i want your answers to be pushed by you in your public github repos.
